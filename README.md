# bamboo
A week 4 project from Sparta to clean and analyse a dataset using Pandas DataFrames and packages like seaborn and matplotlib to create visualisations.



dataset - Google Play Store Apps

In this dataset we have Apps, their categories, ratings, reviews, installs, types, price,
content rating, and genres. 


motivations
Once the data is cleaned, some buisness questions could be:
- Identify the best ratings in regards to the number of reviews. 
- Most popular caegories by looking at categories to ratings 
- and reviews against type (free or paid)



blueprint
- load in data
- turn the csv into a dataframe
- exemplify some techniques to first view what date we do have 
- clean/manipulate the data (keep in mind potential buisness style questions)
